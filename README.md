# Distributed Task Queue Project

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that uses **Celery**, **Redis**, and **FastAPI** to create a system for processing tasks in the background. For example, you can send a task (like processing some data) to the system, and it will handle it while you do other things. It’s like sending a job to a worker who reports back when done!

The project includes:

- A **FastAPI** web server to submit tasks and check their status.
- **Celery** to manage and process tasks in the background.
- **Redis** to store tasks and results.
- **Authentication** so only authorized users can submit tasks.
- **Rate limiting** to prevent too many requests.
- **Flower** to monitor tasks in a web dashboard.

This guide is for beginners. Follow the steps carefully to set up and run the project on **Windows**.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. **Python 3.12** installed. Download it from python.org and install it, checking “Add Python to PATH” during setup.
2. **Docker Desktop** installed. Get it from docker.com and ensure it’s running.
3. **Git** installed. Download it from git-scm.com and install with default settings.
4. **VS Code** (optional but recommended). Download it from code.visualstudio.com.
5. A **GitHub account**. Sign up at github.com if you don’t have one.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your Windows computer.

### Step 1: Clone the Project

1. Open VS Code and go to **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.
2. Navigate to your project folder (e.g., `E:\List`). Type:

   ```
   cd E:\List
   ```

   and press Enter.
3. Clone this repository. Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DhaatuTheGamer/distributed-task-queue
   ```
4. Move into the project folder:

   ```
   cd distributed-task-queue
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up Redis with Docker

1. Open a Command Prompt (search “cmd” in Windows).
2. Start Redis in Docker:

   ```
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis-server redis
   ```
3. Check it’s running:

   ```
   docker ps
   ```

   You should see `redis-server` listed.

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

1. In the VS Code terminal (in the project folder), create a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate it:

   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   You’ll see `(venv)` in the terminal prompt.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

1. Install the project’s packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Verify installation:

   ```
   pip list
   ```

   Check that packages like `celery`, `fastapi`, and `redis` are listed.

### Step 5: Verify Project Files

The project includes two main files:

- `celery_app.py`: Defines the Celery setup and a sample task.
- `main.py`: Runs the FastAPI server with authentication and task endpoints.

Open them in VS Code to explore the code. Don’t edit them unless you want to customize the project.

---

## Database Integration

This project now uses an SQLite database named `tasks_and_users.db`, which will be automatically created in the root directory of the project when you first run the application.

This database serves two main purposes:
1.  **User Authentication:** Stores user credentials. On the first startup, a default test user is created with the following credentials if they don't already exist:
    *   **Username:** `user1`
    *   **Password:** `password1`
    You can use these credentials to obtain an access token for testing.
2.  **Task Persistence:** Stores details and results of all submitted Celery tasks (e.g., `process_task`, `add_numbers`, `simulate_image_processing`). When you query a task's status via the API, the information is retrieved from this database.

The necessary tables (`users` and `tasks`) are also created automatically if they don't exist when the application starts.

---

## Running the Project

You’ll run three components: Redis (already running in Docker), Celery workers, and the FastAPI server.

### Step 1: Start Celery Workers

1. Open a new terminal in VS Code (**Terminal** > **New Terminal**).
2. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Run the worker for the `default` queue:

   ```
   celery -A celery_app worker -Q default --loglevel=info --pool=solo
   ```
4. Open another terminal, activate the virtual environment, and run the worker for the `high_priority` queue:

   ```
   celery -A celery_app worker -Q high_priority --loglevel=info --pool=solo
   ```

   Keep both terminals open.

### Step 2: Start the FastAPI Server

1. Open another terminal in VS Code.
2. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Run the server:

   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   You’ll see output like:

   ```
   INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

   Keep this terminal open.

## Testing the Project

While the following sections describe how to test the system using PowerShell, a simpler Web Interface is now available for interactive testing. See the "Web Interface" section below for details. The PowerShell examples remain valid for scripted testing or direct API interaction.

Use PowerShell to test the system by sending tasks and checking their status. The project uses authentication, so you’ll need a token first. The default credentials (`user1`/`password1`) are created in the database on first startup, as described in the "Database Integration" section.

### Test 1: Get an Access Token

1. Open a PowerShell terminal in VS Code.
2. Run:

   ```
   (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/token" -Method POST -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" } -Body "username=user1&password=password1").Content | ConvertFrom-Json
   ```
3. You’ll see:

   ```json
   {
       "access_token": "some-long-jwt-token",
       "token_type": "bearer"
   }
   ```
4. Copy the `access_token`.

### Test 2: Submitting Different Task Types

This project now supports multiple task types. Here's how to submit them:

#### a. Generic Processing Task

This is the original example task.

1. Run this command, replacing `your-jwt-token` with the token:

   ```powershell
   (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/tasks/process" -Method POST -Headers @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer your-jwt-token"; "Content-Type" = "application/json" } -Body '{"data": "example data"}').Content | ConvertFrom-Json
   ```
2. You’ll see:

   ```json
   {
       "task_id": "some-uuid"
   }
   ```
3. Copy the `task_id` to use in Test 3.

#### b. Process Numbers Task

This task accepts a list of numbers and returns their sum.

-   **Endpoint**: `POST /tasks/process-numbers`
-   **Authentication**: Required (Bearer Token).
-   **Request Body**: JSON object with a `numbers` key (array of numbers).
    Example:
    ```powershell
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/tasks/process-numbers" -Method POST -Headers @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer your-jwt-token"; "Content-Type" = "application/json" } -Body '{"numbers": [1, 2, 3.5, 10]}').Content | ConvertFrom-Json
    ```
-   **Response**: JSON object with `task_id`.
    ```json
    {
        "task_id": "some-other-uuid"
    }
    ```
    Copy this `task_id` to check its status using the method in Test 3. The expected result, retrieved from the database, would be `{"task_id": "some-other-uuid", "name": "add_numbers", "status": "SUCCESS", "result": "16.5", ...}`. (Note: The exact structure and `status` field value might vary based on Celery version and DB schema).

#### c. Simulate Image Processing Task

This task accepts an image identifier (string) and simulates processing.

-   **Endpoint**: `POST /tasks/process-image`
-   **Authentication**: Required (Bearer Token).
-   **Request Body**: JSON object with an `image_id` key (string).
    Example:
    ```powershell
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/tasks/process-image" -Method POST -Headers @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer your-jwt-token"; "Content-Type" = "application/json" } -Body '{"image_id": "img_123.jpg"}').Content | ConvertFrom-Json
    ```
-   **Response**: JSON object with `task_id`.
    ```json
    {
        "task_id": "yet-another-uuid"
    }
    ```
    Copy this `task_id` to check its status. The expected result, retrieved from the database, would be `{"task_id": "yet-another-uuid", "name": "simulate_image_processing", "status": "SUCCESS", "result": "Image img_123.jpg processed successfully.", ...}`.

### Test 3: Check Task Status

This endpoint now retrieves task information directly from the SQLite database.

1. Wait for the task to process (e.g., 5 seconds for the original generic task, 1 second for image processing).
2. Run, replacing `some-uuid` and `your-jwt-token`:

   ```
   (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/tasks/some-uuid" -Method GET -Headers @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer your-jwt-token" }).Content | ConvertFrom-Json
   ```
3. You’ll see:
   - If still processing:

     ```json
     {
         "status": "pending"
     }
     ```
   - If done:

     ```json
     {
         "task_id": "some-uuid",
         "name": "process_task", 
         "status": "SUCCESS", // Or other status like PENDING, FAILURE
         "result": "Processed: example data",
         "created_at": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff",
         "completed_at": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff" // Or null if pending/failed
     }
     ```
     The exact fields returned will match the `TaskResultModel` and the data stored in the `tasks` table.

## Web Interface

A simple web interface is available to interact with the task submission system. Once the FastAPI server is running, you can access this UI by navigating to:

[http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

The interface provides the following functionalities:

1.  **User Login:**
    *   Enter your credentials to obtain an API token.
    *   For initial testing, you can use the default user:
        *   **Username:** `user1`
        *   **Password:** `password1`
    *   The obtained API token will be displayed and used automatically for subsequent requests.

2.  **Task Submission:**
    *   Once logged in, forms will appear for submitting each type of supported task:
        *   Generic Process Task
        *   Add Numbers Task
        *   Simulate Image Processing Task
    *   Fill in the required data and click the respective submit button.
    *   The API response, including the `task_id`, will be displayed.

3.  **Check Task Status:**
    *   Enter a `task_id` obtained from a task submission.
    *   Click "Check Status" to retrieve and display the latest status and result for that task from the database.

This web UI offers a more user-friendly way to test and use the task queue compared to command-line tools.

## Monitoring Tasks with Flower

Flower is a web dashboard to see your tasks in action.

1. Open a new terminal in VS Code.
2. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Run Flower:

   ```
   celery -A celery_app flower
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5555`.
5. You’ll see a dashboard showing your workers and tasks.

---

## Stopping the Project

When you’re done, stop all services:

1. **Celery Workers**: Press `Ctrl + C` in each worker terminal.
2. **FastAPI Server**: Press `Ctrl + C` in the Uvicorn terminal.
3. **Flower**: Press `Ctrl + C` in the Flower terminal.
4. **Redis**: In a Command Prompt, run:

   ```
   docker stop redis-server
   ```

To restart later, follow the “Running the Project” steps.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Redis not running**: Check with `docker ps`. Restart with `docker start redis-server`.
- **FastAPI errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- **Task not processing**: Verify both Celery workers are running.
- **PowerShell errors**: Double-check token and task ID in commands.
- **Need help?**: Ask on GitHub Issues or check Stack Overflow.

---

## What’s Next?

You’ve built a cool system! Here are ideas to make it better:

- Add more tasks in `celery_app.py` (e.g., process numbers or images).
- Connect a database to store task results.
- Create a web page to submit tasks instead of PowerShell.

## Security Recommendations

This section outlines important security considerations for this application:

1.  **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   Regularly scan `requirements.txt` and all dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit`, Snyk, or Trivy. Keep dependencies updated to patched versions.

2.  **CSRF Protection:**
    *   While JWTs are used (which can offer some CSRF protection if tokens are not stored in client-side JavaScript accessible cookies), consider implementing explicit CSRF protection mechanisms, especially if session cookies are used or if there are concerns about token handling.

3.  **Production Error Handling:**
    *   Ensure that detailed error messages or stack traces, which might reveal sensitive system information, are not exposed to clients in a production environment. Implement robust error handling that logs details server-side but shows generic error messages to users.

4.  **Idempotent Celery Tasks:**
    *   The Celery configuration in `celery_app.py` uses `task_acks_late = True`. This enhances fault tolerance but means a task could potentially be executed more than once if a worker fails after starting a task but before acknowledging its completion. Ensure that all Celery tasks (like `process_task`) are designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be safely executed multiple times with the same input without causing unintended side effects.

5.  **Secret Management:**
    *   The `SECRET_KEY` for JWT signing in `main.py` has been modified to be loaded from the `APP_SECRET_KEY` environment variable. Ensure this environment variable is set to a strong, unique, randomly generated key in your production environment. Do not commit the actual secret key to version control.

6.  **Database Security:**
    *   The application has been updated to remove the hardcoded `fake_users_db`. When integrating a real database for user authentication and other data storage:
        *   Use strong, unique credentials for database access.
        *   Limit database user privileges to the minimum required.
        *   Consider network ACLs or firewalls to restrict database access.
        *   Use Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

7.  **Celery Broker/Backend Security:**
    *   As noted in `celery_app.py`, secure your Celery broker and backend (e.g., Redis) with passwords, network restrictions, and potentially SSL/TLS if accessed over untrusted networks.

8.  **Rate Limiting with Proxies:**
    *   As noted in `main.py`, if deploying behind a reverse proxy, ensure the rate limiting mechanism correctly identifies client IPs by checking headers like `X-Forwarded-For`.

## New Task Endpoints

These tasks require authentication (Bearer Token).

### Process Numbers Task
- **Endpoint:** `POST /tasks/process-numbers`
- **Description:** Accepts a list of numbers and returns their sum.
- **Request Body:** JSON object with a `numbers` key (array of numbers).
  ```json
  {
      "numbers": [1, 2, 3.5, 4]
  }
  ```
- **Response:** JSON object with `task_id`.
  ```json
  {
      "task_id": "some-celery-task-id"
  }
  ```
- **Result via `/tasks/{task_id}`:** The sum of the numbers, retrieved from the database.

### Simulate Image Processing Task
- **Endpoint:** `POST /tasks/process-image`
- **Description:** Accepts an image identifier (string) and simulates processing.
- **Request Body:** JSON object with an `image_id` key (string).
  ```json
  {
      "image_id": "image_example_001.png"
  }
  ```
- **Response:** JSON object with `task_id`.
  ```json
  {
      "task_id": "another-celery-task-id"
  }
  ```
- **Result via `/tasks/{task_id}`:** A message like "Image image_example_001.png processed successfully.", retrieved from the database.
